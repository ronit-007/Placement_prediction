## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts the placement of a student.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at collage and having a strong base of mathematics and keen intrest in learning ML ,DL and AI? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.




## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.
